description: Split this repo's plan.md into GitHub issues with gh, one per unit of work, after a human has reviewed the split. Use when a plan is ready and has no issues yet.

# plan-to-issues

Turns `plan.md` into GitHub issues that workers can pick up cold. Easiest with `gh`, authenticated,
in a shell this agent can run.

## Steps

1. Read `plan.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/adr/`.
2. Draft the split as a table: title · plan section · scope · done when · blocked by.
   One issue per unit of work.
3. **Stop and show the table to the human.** Publish nothing until they approve it.
4. Every issue carries the shape under [Issue shape](#issue-shape). Ask the human only about
   anything beyond it.
5. Create each issue in dependency order, so blocked-by can cite real numbers. Create the
   plan's label first if it doesn't exist:

   ```sh
   gh label create "plan:<plan>" --description "Plan: <plan>"
   gh issue create --title "<title>" --label "plan:<plan>" --body-file <tmp.md>
   ```

6. Record every issue URL from gh's output (not from memory) and reply with the list.

Closing one, with the closing comment from AGENTS.md:

```sh
gh issue close <n> -c "<closing comment>"
```

## Issue shape

Agreed with the human on the morning-digest plan. The body opens with the source line, and the
reviewer sorts by it and the label:

```md
Source: plan.md § <n>

**Scope:** <what this issue changes, and what it leaves to other issues>

**Done when:** <the plan's done condition, checkable>

**Blocked by:** <#n, … or —; name anything outside the repo it waits on, e.g. a review>
```

- Label: `plan:<plan>`, the `plan:` value from plan.md's frontmatter.
- A section split in two (e.g. types first, then the code) keeps the same `§ <n>` on both.
- An issue whose done condition depends on someone else (a reviewer's look) stays open until
  they confirm, even when the work is sent. Its blocked-by and closing comment say so.

## No `gh`

Steps 1–4 hold either way. GitHub reachable another way (a connector, the REST API, the web UI):
the same issues, made that way. GitHub issues out of reach altogether: write them as files in
`docs/issues/`, format in ADR 0004, then commit and push.

## Don'ts

- Don't paste the whole plan into one issue, and don't keep issues only in chat.
- Don't invent sections the plan doesn't have. If the plan is unclear, ask.
